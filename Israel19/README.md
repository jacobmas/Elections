# High Arab Turnout Scenario for 2019 Elections for the 21st Knesset

Raw Data for 21st Knesset Election taken April 15, 2019 from the [Elections website](https://votes21.bechirot.gov.il/)

Scenario envisioned is 85% Arab turnout, which, per "The Rise of the State of Israel" chapter in "The Jews: their role in civilization" (ed. Louis Finkelstein, Schocken Books), was achieved in the Arab polity in 2 of the first 3 elections. 

In order to attempt to map out this scenario, I changed the vote totals in Arab areas to reflect 85% turnout while retaining the same proportions of the vote for each party. I defined Arab areas as follows:

* All of the  Arab localities in Israel (labeled as ערבי under סוג הישוב in the spreadsheets), regardless of the percentage of the vote given to the Arab parties. All of these localities have only very small if any non-Arab populations.

* Those "kalpiot" in the "mixed cities" of Israel (Akko, Haifa, Maalot-Tarshiha , Jerusalem, Lod, Nazareth Illit, Ramle and Tel Aviv-Yafo) which gave at least 20% of the vote to Arab parties. Some of these kalpiot likely contain significant non-Arab ("Jews and others") populations, and a significant number of Arabs likely voted in kalpiot giving less than 20% to the Arab parties.

After adjusting the votes in these areas as described above, I proceeded to use the Ofer-Bader method as described [here](https://main.knesset.gov.il/EN/About/Lexicon/Pages/seats.aspx), adjusting for the fact that the threshold was since raised to 3.25% in order to compute what the hypothetical distribution of seats would have been under this adjusted scenario.

* Blue and White: 33
* Likud: 33
* Hadash-Ta'al: 9
* Ra'am-Balad: 7
* Shas: 7
* United Torah Judaism: 7
* Labour: 6
* Meretz: 5
* Yisrael Beitenu: 5
* Kulanu: 4
* United Right Wing Parties: 4

which gives 

* Right-Religious: 60 seats
* Arab+Center-Left: 60 seats

# Very Brief Analysis

This would've presumably made a secular broad government the only workable coalition (e.g. Blue and White, Likud and possibly some/all of Kulanu,Labor,Yisrael Beitenu)

On the one hand, I suppose there is very much a question of how much more such a government would have done for Arab citizens of Israel, but I can't imagine it wouldn't be better.
